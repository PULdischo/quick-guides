# quick-guides
Collection of "quick-guides" for various digital tools and platforms

## Contributing
Anyone is invited to contribute to quick-guides, but inclusion in the repository is subject to PUL DiScho's review. 

We prefer guides on tools that are open source, but accept guides on proprietary tools that are industry standards (for example, tools like [ArcGIS Storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) and [oXygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/)). 

For members of the PUL organization, follow these steps to contribute a guide:
- at the top of this page, under the title "quick-guides," select "create new file" (next to green "code" button).
- this option will open a new window where you can add content.
- at the top, name your file after your tool with an .md extensition, for example, "palladio.md".
- add content then press "commit changes". Make sure you include a commit message (but no need to add an extended description).
  - for images: add image files to the /img/ folder in the root (the first, main folder) of the repository.
  - in your markdown, make sure all of your image file paths lead to this folder.
  - name your image files after the tool, with a number (if using more than one image) afterward. For example, "palladio1.png", "palladio2.png", and so on.

For external contributors, the process requires [forking this repository then creating a pull request](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project). Here is an overview of the steps:
- Fork the project.
- Create a topic branch from main.
- Add your file following the instructions in the above section (for members of PUL).
- Push this branch to your GitHub project.
- Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
- The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
- Sync the updated master back to your fork.


## Format
The guides use markdown file types and syntax for authoring content. Please refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more information. 

### Length
Guide will vary in length, depending on the tool. But they should conform to the following structure:

### Title
Include the title of the tool in first level heading. Under the title:
  - link to tool's website and documentation and/or tutorials, as relevant.
  - include an overview of tool, what it can produce or do, and what kind of data it works on.

### Subheadings
Use subheadings include specific steps for using the tool. Instructions should be as high level as possible, while containing enough specific information to orient total beginners. Subheadings can be nested as necessary to reflect the components of that particular tool and the process of using it. Examples include:
- "Creating an exhibit".
- "Add captions".
- "Graph".

### Images
All images should be linked to a relative path within the /img/ folder, and conform to the naming conventions (i.e. using the tool name and a number to indicate multiple images, for example, "palladio1.png", "palladio2.png", and so on).

### Further Reading & Contributors
At the bottom, include links to further reading (if relevant) and contributor information. If adapted from a previous guide, state the original author and source. Finally, include your own name as a creator or editor.
